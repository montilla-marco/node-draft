Module in Node.js is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple JavaScript files which
can be reused throughout the Node.js application.

Each module in Node.js has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or pollute global scope.
  Also, each module can be placed in a separate.js file under a separate folder.
